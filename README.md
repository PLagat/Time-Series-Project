Time Series Analysis of the relationship between GDP Growth Rate and Youth Unemployment in Kenya
In Kenya, the field of youth unemployment has a significant amount of research that has been carried out to analyze its trends and consequences. However, little attention has been paid to the factors that drive youth unemployment and as such, the relative low youth employment rate remains largely unexplained. 
This project aims to contribute to this void by investigating if growth in Kenya’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) will influence the country’s unemployment rate which is measured by the number of unemployed people divided by the total number of people in the workforce.
